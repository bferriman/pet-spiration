# PetSpiration

## Description

When you've given up on human companionship but you're not ready to give up the fun of a dating app, you need **PetSpiration!**

**PetSpiration** helps you determine what qualities you're looking for in a potential pet. We'll start by showing you a series of cute pet photos. If you like what you see, click 👍. If you don't, click 👎. Once we have enough information, our algorithm will match you with local, adoptable pets that meet the qualities you're looking for in a furry friend.

If you think you're ready to start a lasting relationship with one of your pet matches, we'll help you out by giving you directions to your local animal shelter.

Every day, people fall in love on **PetSpiration!**

## Usage

Users are invited to search our site for cats. Individual pictures of cats are shown one at a time with the option of selecting thumbs up or thumbs down. Based on the selection, data is collected regarding the color, coat length and lifestage of the cat to determine the user's preferences. These preferences, along with the geolocation of the user, then provide the user with adoptable cats in shelters in their vicinity along with directions to the location of the shelter.

## Gen 2 Options

Our initial intent was to create a site for finding various types of pets to include cats, dogs, birds and rabbits. However, we decided to initially focus on one type of pet allowing us to work out the structure with the plan to expand to additional pet types in future generations.
